## A Brief Introduction to Edge AI

* Embedded systems are meant to perform one specific, dedicated task.
* The data obtained from sensors tends to have a very high volume but a relatively low informational content.
* Send large volumes to low-value information is very costly and energy intensive. Due to this a majority of data collected by IoT sensors are usually discarded.
* `Edge AI` - Instead of sending data off to some distant location for processing, decisions are taken locally. Only send important information to the servers.

* Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is the practice of using algorithms to manipulate the data captured by embedded systems. DSP is used to modify signals which are fed to ML systems.

## Benefits of Edge AI
BLERP

* Bandwidth
* Latency
* Economics
* Reliability
* Privacy


## Edge AI Vs Regular AI
* Edge AI is ususally used for inference. It is rare to train models on the edge devices. Edge devices will lack labeled data which will be required for training.
* Focus of edge AI is on sensor data. DSP is a critical part of most edge AI deployments.
* ML models can get very small. 
* Learning from feedback is limited.
* Compute is diverse and heterogeneous - Microcontrollers, System-on-chip (SoC), FPGAs etc
* "Good enough" is often the goal
* Tools and best practices are still evolving
