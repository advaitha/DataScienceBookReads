    "text": "Embedded systems are meant to perform one specific, dedicated task.\nThe data obtained from sensors tends to have a very high volume but a relatively low informational content.\nSend large volumes to low-value information is very costly and energy intensive.

Only send important information to the servers.\n\n\n\n\nCloud ane Edge Continnum\n\n\n\nDigital Signal Processing (DSP) is the practice of using algorithms to manipulate the data captured by embedded systems.
