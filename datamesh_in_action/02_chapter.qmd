# Is Data Mesh right for you?

## Decision drivers for data mesh
`key Decision Drivers` are:-

* Business need
* socio-technically complex organization
* Data Maturity 
* Engineering Maturity
* A data mesh is for companies with complex domains
* A data mesh is for companies with diverse data sources
* Data Governance maturity - Easier to implement in companies with higher data governance maturity
* Data mesh is easier to implement in companies in which software is developed in close cooperation with data experts
* Data mesh is easier to implement in companies that are following a domain-driven design approach


### Business drivers
* Are we planning to be data driven?
* A data mesh requires a business case and is useful when there are related complex needs

### Organizational drivers
* A data mesh is for socio-technically complex organization with complex data needs

#### Data Maturity Model
* Four stages of Data Maturity
    * Descriptive - what happened?
    * Diagnostic - why it happened?
    * Predictive - what will happen?
    * Prescriptive - How to take advantage of what will happen?
* A data mesh is for companies with a certain level of data maturity. 

#### Engineering Maturity
* Level of test automation
* DevOps and CI/CD culture
* Level of embedding security into the development process
* A data mesh is for companies with a high level of software engineering maturity

### Domain-data drivers
* A data mesh is for companies with complex domains
* A data mesh is for companies with diverse data sources


## Minor drivers

### Data Governance Maturity Model
* It divides governance maturity into six tiers:
    * Unaware
    * Aware
    * Reactive
    * Proactive
    * Managed
    * Efficient

## Alternatives to Data Mesh

### Enterprise data warehouse
Suitable in the following cases:-
* Most of the data sources are structured
* Well known use cases and not likely to expand
* You extract value by using BI or reporting
* Small number of unchanging source systems
* Central team has expertise in data warehousing

### Data lake
Suitable in the following cases:-
* Deal with big data
* Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources
* Hard to foresee all the data use cases
* Data sources owned by small number of teams
* consumption patterns are not yet established

### Data lakehouse
Features of a lakehouse:-
* ACID support
* schema enforcement and governance
* BI support on top of the same data source

Suitable in the following cases:-
* Deal with big data
* Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources
* Hard to foresee all the data use cases
* Data sources owned by small number of teams
* consumption patterns are not yet established

`The elements of a data mesh may be constructed with existing infrastructure`

### Data fabric
This is a technology centric solution to data management.It provides a low-code or no-code platform to connect data sources with consumers alongside governance applied on top of it.

Suitable in the following cases:-
* You have structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources.
* You are dealing with big data.
* There are many data sources, and they are owned by many teams.
* You are dealing with many different ways to consume the data.

### Steps for creating a data mesh
* Choosing a business goal and enable with data
* Define the data products needed
* Develop data product
* Collect feedback about the platform and analyze shared needs
* Establish common policies and improve governance
* Develop the platform
    * It should connect data products and data consumers
    * Automating the implementation of governance policies
